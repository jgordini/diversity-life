## Commitment Statement

At UAB IT, what creates our competitive advantage and sets us apart from all others is our people. We know that what makes each individual different is their varied perspective that is based on the distinctive combination of their backgrounds and experiences. And when we combine those individuals, we create a unique team with the joint mission of propelling the university forward through technology. For that reason, UAB IT is intentional about fostering an inclusive workplace that supports each of our team members and their differences as well as an inclusive and welcoming environment for all campus partners, community partners, or all that comes in contact with UAB IT.
