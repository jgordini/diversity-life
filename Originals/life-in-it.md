### Who is UAB IT?

UAB IT is the UAB organization that supports the campus and its technology needs.

We support the university through our various units including client services, networking & telecommunications, infrastructure, application development, information security, research computing and business operations.

Our UAB IT [mission and vision](https://www.uab.edu/it/home/about) sets the groundwork for what we do and why we do IT.

### Why we do it?

IT is a critical part of the foundation for the university’s success. We strive to empower the university to accomplish its [mission](https://www.uab.edu/plan/the-plan/mission-vision-shared-values) and the [university’s strategic plan](https://www.uab.edu/plan/) by meeting its technology needs while seeking to advance and move the university forward.

UAB’s IT Strategic Plan, based on the strategic imperatives of the university, outlines our initiatives to use technology to create a competitive advantage for the university. We are committed to achieving at least 100 wins for UAB each year and have successfully reached this goal since inception.

### Why UAB IT?

In order to empower the students, faculty, and staff at UAB, we must empower our employees and provide them with the motivation necessary to move the organization forward. We do this by providing our employees with:

Annually, employees receive an evaluation that outlines their achievement of goals, meeting core values, and training plan initiatives.

Additionally, UAB IT has an employee recognition program to recognize peers and teammates for meeting our core values.

### Our IT Core Values

The [UAB IT Core Values](https://www.uab.edu/it/home/about) of trust, excellence, accountability, collaboration, service, innovation, and gratitude serve as a compass for the behaviors expected from our IT employees and a basis for our culture. Here, how we do our jobs is just as important as what we do in our jobs. These IT Core Values, in conjunction with the [shared values of the university,](https://www.uab.edu/plan/the-plan/mission-vision-shared-values) set the standard for how our UAB IT employees are expected to meet their job responsibilities in support of our strategic plan; our mission and vision; and the strategic mission of the university.
